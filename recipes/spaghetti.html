        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Spaghetti (Italian: [spaghetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals.
        Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.</p>
    
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>

       <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 quarts of water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Steps</h2>

       <ol>
        <li>Boil the spaghetti: In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the salt and stir. Add the spaghetti to 
            the boiling water and stir occasionally until it's cooked to your liking,
             about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce: While the spaghetti is cooking, heat the olive oil in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper to taste. 
            Let the sauce simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti: Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it in a colander and return it to the pot.</li>
        <li>Serve: Pour the tomato sauce over the spaghetti and stir to combine. Serve hot, 
            topped with chopped basil and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
       </ol>
